Hello!

This is my personal project to track my reading and thoughts about it.

**Challenges**

I am currently working to achieve two reading challenges, both are self-imposed and long-term goals. It's an aspiration for me, but not something I put pressure on in a way that would negatively impact my reading. 

1. Read one book from every country in the world. *Achievable step to get there one day*: Read one book from one country I haven't read from per month. The progress of countries I have read is tracked in [[Dashboards/Country Overview\|Country Overview]]. 
2. Read every single book in my apartment, so that some day (soon), I can say that I have read all of the stuff on my bookshelves. *Achievable step to get there one day*: I am only allowed to buy one new book if I have finished at least two. Gifted books count as if bought. I'm tracking what's left in [[Physical TBR.base]] & [[Dashboards/Physical TBR\|Physical TBR]].
