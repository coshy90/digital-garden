## The Library of the Dead

## My thoughts & notable quotes

Rounded up 2.5/5. Went in with wrong expectations, thinking I'd be reading an adult urban fantasy book set in Scotland, and instead got a young adult book narrated by a snotty 14-year old. 

Really liked the overall idea for the world building and the setting, although the book barely made use of it and mostly glances over the more interesting aspects of its universe. 
The narrator is surely hit or miss, and I am sure that some people may find her funny, relatable and cheeky, but sadly, the first-person narration mostly irritated me. 

Big part of that might be down to the disconnected and often random inner monologue of the protagonist, as well as the very unfitting pop-culture references that don't make sense and feel more like something the author thinks is cool rather than something that a 14 year old teenager in a near-future dystopia would quote. 

Parts of the plot were very enjoyable, with a good pacing and almost horror-like set pieces, but sadly the author did not stick the landing or give it the space and runway it deserved.
