## Case Closed, Vol. 41

### Description

When Richard Moore flubs a ten-million-yen case, two women step in to save the day: Eva Kaden, crack attorney and Richard’s ex-wife, and Vivian Kudo, brilliant actress and Jimmy Kudo’s mom! But the brainy blond duo is up against a killer who can go anywhere without being seen! Meanwhile, shadowy figures are trailing Anita and Conan, and ditzy American teacher Miss Jodie seems to know far more than she pretends. Have the Men in Black finally caught up to the shrunken sleuth? -- VIZ Media
