## One Piece, Vol. 11

### Description

After almost drowning at the hands of "Saw-Tooth" Arlong, captain of the nasty Fish-Man pirates, Luffy bounces back with a few tricks up his sleeve. The fate of Coco Village, if not the rest of the East Blue, rests on the outcome of their final battle! -- VIZ Media
