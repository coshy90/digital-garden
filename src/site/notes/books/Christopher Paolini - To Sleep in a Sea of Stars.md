## To Sleep in a Sea of Stars

### Description

She dreamed of life on new worlds. Now she has awakened a nightmare. To Sleep in a Sea of Stars is a masterful, epic science fiction novel from Christopher Paolini, the Sunday Times bestselling author of Eragon and the Inheritance Cycle. *Winner of the 2020 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Science Fiction Novel* During a routine survey of an uncolonized planet, Kira Navárez finds an alien relic. At first she’s delighted, but elation turns to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to move. First contact isn’t at all what Kira imagined, bringing new revelations and a transformation that will push her to the very limits of what it means to be human. But when Kira’s discovery leads to war among the stars, she is launched into a galaxy-spanning mission, determined to end what she started. While she faces unimaginable peril, the world and its colonies is driven to the brink of annihilation. And Kira becomes humanity’s greatest – and final – hope . . .
