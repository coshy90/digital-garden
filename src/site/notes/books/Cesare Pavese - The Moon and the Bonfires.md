## The Moon and the Bonfires

### Store description

"The narrator's reminiscences unfold on three parallel levels: his boyhood as a bastard child in a Piedmonteses farm, his failure to find a home in America, and his return to the village in the aftermath of the war, of partisan strife and of buried political hopes. Pavese is hauted by the feeling that modern life has no roots. Our life is either mechanical or utopian, practical or fanatical. Amid the poverty-striken people of backward countries, sap is still flowing, he says, but it may very well dry up soon."--Dust cover.
