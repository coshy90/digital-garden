## The Calling of the Grave

### Description

* Don't miss 'THE CHEMISTRY OF DEATH' TV SERIES - now streaming on Paramount+ * Adapted from The Chemistry of Death and Written in Bone - starring Harry Treadaway as Dr David Hunter 'As bone-chillingly bleak as its subject . . . this doesn't disappoint' Financial Times A serial killer is on the loose and David Hunter suddenly finds that the past is far from dead and buried. The escape of a psychotic rapist and multiple murderer brings DI Terry Connor to David Hunter's doorstep, years after their bitter rift. This unwelcome reminder of the past forces Hunter to confront the situation at hand: eight years earlier Hunter and an ill-fated Body Recovery team, has tried to find the graves of Monk's teenage victims on the bleak expanse of Dartmoor. Only one of the missing girls' bodies was ever found. Suddenly Hunter receives an appeal from Sophie Keller, a young woman who also worked on the operation, and nothing is quite as it seems. Hunter is forced to question who he can really trust. Especially when his own life depends on it.
