## Don't Talk About Politics

## My thoughts & notable quotes

Important and insightful. Functions as a great summary of many concepts you will already be familiar with if you're invested in political change and/or science, but weaves them all together in a new, inspired and meaningful way. 

The author does not provide a lot of academic footnotes or research sources, which in my opinion makes sense for this work to appeal and be accessible to as broad an audience as possible. 

Before you engage in fights on social media, read this. 

### Store description

Democracy is dying because we are clinging to a dangerous and outdated myth: talking about politics can change people's minds. It doesn't.
