## Galatea

### Description

From the internationally bestselling and prize-winning author of The Song of Achilles and Circe, an enchanting short story that boldly reimagines the myth of Galatea and Pygmalion. **A small hardback edition featuring a new afterword by Madeline Miller** In Ancient Greece, a skilled marble sculptor has been blessed by a goddess who has given his masterpiece – the most beautiful woman the town has ever seen – the gift of life. Now his wife, he expects Galatea to please him, to be obedience and humility personified. But she has desires of her own, and yearns for independence. In a desperate bid by her obsessive husband to keep her under control, she is locked away under the constant supervision of doctors and nurses. But with a daughter to rescue, she is determined to break free, whatever the cost... _________________________ Praise for CIRCE 'A thrilling tour de force of imagination' Mail on Sunday 'A bold and subversive retelling' New York Times 'A novel to be gobbled greedily in one sitting' Observer 'A remarkable achievement' Sunday Times
