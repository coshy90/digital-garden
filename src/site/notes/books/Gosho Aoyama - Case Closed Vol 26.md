## Case Closed, Vol. 26

### Description

Conan wakes up in the hospital, the victim of a gunshot wound...and things just go downhill from there. Has Rachel finally figured out that Conan and Jimmy Kudo are one in the same? But the drama really builds when a real-life murder interrupts Rachel's school play...and a familiar teenage boy steps out of the wings to tackle the case. It's not a dream! Not a flashback! Not an imaginary story! Jimmy Kudo is back! -- VIZ Media
