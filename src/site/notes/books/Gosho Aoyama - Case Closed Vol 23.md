## Case Closed, Vol. 23

### Description

Surely the Junior Detective League can't get into any trouble at an afternoon monster movie. But when a man in the audience dies, Conan and Anita realize that the real monster isn't the big green behemoth on the screen. Then Rachel gets her own movie moment, playing Rose--minus Jack--at the prow of a glittering ocean liner. When a suspicious explosion kills the romance, it's time for Conan and teen detective Harley Hartwell to make sure that the passengers' hearts will go on! -- VIZ Media
