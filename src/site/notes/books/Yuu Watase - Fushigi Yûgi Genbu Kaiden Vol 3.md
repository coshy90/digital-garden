## Fushigi Yûgi: Genbu Kaiden, Vol. 3

### Description

Takiko has found three Celestial Warriors, but four remain hidden. While she and her friends journey to the Oracle Anlu, who may have the power to locate the remaining warriors, Limdo travels undercover with the army of Qu-dong. At Turning Point Rockfield, their destinies will intertwine again...and Takiko will learn that her quest is more difficult than she imagined. If she's already located three of the seven warriors, why does the Oracle claim there are five still to be found? -- VIZ Media
