## Having People Over

### Store description

Become the perfect host and learn how to foster community as an adult with this modern guide to hosting every type of gathering. In a world that often feels disconnected and transactional, there's nothing more radically hospitable than welcoming people into your space, your table, and your life. In this accessible, inviting book on hosting and entertaining, author, CEO, and internet big sister Chelsea Fagan guides readers on creating moments worth staying in for. From designing the right space, to crafting a menu that won’t keep you in the kitchen all night, to revitalizing the lost art of cultivating grown-up communities, this book will make you the perfect host at every budget. Having People Over includes guides for: • Curating a space optimized for entertaining, so people can drop by without it sending you into a tailspin. • A brief history of the cocktail hour—and its imagined future—including recipes with and without spirits. • The 101 tutorial for all things dinner parties: inviting guests, setting the table, planning a menu, creating a mood board, and actually enjoying the evening yourself. • Facilitating a (platonic) adult sleepover—and why you definitely should! • How to be good guest wherever you go, from when to show up, to what to bring, to what absolutely not to do. With chic, stylized photography and charming, illustrative line drawings throughout—providing everything from sample tablescapes to charcuterie board maps—and plenty of actual recipes for your next gathering, Having People Over will transform your relationship to entertaining, one apéritif at a time.
