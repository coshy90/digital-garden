## One Piece, Vol. 27

### Description

Join Monkey D. Luffy and his swashbuckling crew in their search for the ultimate treasure, One Piece! As a child, Monkey D. Luffy dreamed of becoming King of the Pirates. But his life changed when he accidentally gained the power to stretch like rubber…at the cost of never being able to swim again! Years, later, Luffy sets off in search of the “One Piece,” said to be the greatest treasure in the world... The Straw Hats have been branded criminals for entering Skypiea without paying the toll! Their only chance for a way out is a series of challenges given to them by Kami's vassals. Meanwhile, Nico Robin makes an important discovery about the island. Is there a city of gold hidden on Skypiea?
