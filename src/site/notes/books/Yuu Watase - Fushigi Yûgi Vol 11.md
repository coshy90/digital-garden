## Fushigi Yûgi, Vol. 11

### Description

A Beloved Fantasy From One Of Japan's Top CreatorsProlific shôjo (""girls"") comics artist Yuu Watase has created a wonderfully exciting, funny, and heartfelt tale of a normal junior-high-school girl who is transported into a fictional version of ancient China. She encounters base villains and dashing heroes, and still manages to worry about her grades and where her next banquet is coming from. Veteran The first Shentso-Pao treasure from the northern country of Bei-Jia was stolen from Miaka, and the only treasure left is in the western country of Xi-Lang—and both Miaka and her friend-turned-mortal-enemy Yui are intent on getting the treasure for themselves! But Xi-Lang isn’t a frozen wasteland of forgotten dreams and ghosts like Bei-Jia. It’s a vibrant, living desert country, whose inhabitants are veterans of the last clash between priestesses and gods!
