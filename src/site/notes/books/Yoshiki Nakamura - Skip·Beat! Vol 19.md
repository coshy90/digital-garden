## Skip·Beat!, Vol. 19

### Description

When Kyoko’s heart is broken, she decides that revenge is a dish best served in the spotlight! Kyoko Mogami followed her true love Sho to Tokyo to support him while he made it big as an idol. But he’s casting her out now that he’s famous! Kyoko won’t suffer in silence—she’s going to get her sweet revenge by beating Sho in show biz! Koo and Lory can't stop meddling in Kyoko's and Ren's lives. Because while Koo is impressed with Kyoko's talent, he knows that she will never be a great actress unless she can overcome her fatal weakness. And Lory knows that Ren's acting is likewise affected by his refusal to face his past. Can the two old-timers give their young protégés a much-needed kick in the pants, or will their plans blow up in their faces?!
