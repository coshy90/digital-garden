## Everything is Everything

### Store description

THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING MEMOIR, NOW UPDATED WITH NEW MATERIAL Readers LOVE Everything is Everything: 'Clive Myrie is one heck of an author' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 'Well written and thought provoking. One to come back to again' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 'Thoughtful, analytical, deeply caring and, at times, very funny' ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ----------------- As a Bolton teenager with a paper round, Clive Myrie read all the newspapers he delivered from cover to cover and dreamed of becoming a journalist. In this deeply personal memoir, he tells how his family history has influenced his view of the world, introducing us to his Windrush generation parents, a great grandfather who helped build the Panama Canal, and a great uncle who fought in the First World War, later to become a prominent police detective in Jamaica. He reflects on how being black has affected his perspective on issues he's encountered in thirty years reporting some of the biggest stories of our time (most recently from Ukraine and Israel), showing us how those experiences gave him a better idea of what it means to be an outsider. He tells of his pride in his roots, but his determination not to be defined by his background in dealing with the challenges of race and class to succeed at the highest level. Moving, engaging, revealing, Everything is Everything is a story of love and hate - but also hope. ---------------- 'Beautifully written' - Claudia Winkleman 'Deeply moving' - Trevor McDonald 'Read this!' - Lenny Henry 'Infinitely more readable than the average journalism memoir, and decidedly more important.' - Sathnam Sanghera 'So engaging. You feel as if he is talking to you, sharing ideas and thoughts, as if you were a friend.' - Yasmin Alibhai-Brown
