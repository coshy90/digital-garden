## The Girl Who Played With Fire

### Description

THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO RETURNS "Even more gripping and astonishing than the first" Sunday Times Lisbeth Salander can be viciously violent. Mikael Blomkvist knows it - and owes his life to it. When a criminologist and a journalist who works with Blomkvist at Millennium magazine are killed on the brink of publishing a brutal expos√© of human trafficking, the evidence points in one direction. Salander's prints are on the murder weapon. But Blomkvist knows Lisbeth would never act without reason, and he cannot find one here. The victims were his friends. But so is Salander. Something much more dangerous is surely at play . . . "That rare thing - a sequel that is even better than the book that went before" Observer *** Want more Lisbeth? THE GIRL WITH ICE IN HER VEINS, coming August 2025, is available to pre-order now! ***
