## The Devils

## My thoughts & notable quotes

Abercrombie is masterful at writing action scenes and weaving storylines together into one great ending. The characters feel really well developed and have distinct characteristics and voices. 

### Store description

A brand-new epic fantasy from New York Times bestselling author Joe Abercrombie, featuring a notorious band of anti-heroes on a delightfully bloody and raucous journey Holy work sometimes requires unholy deeds. Brother Diaz has been summoned to the Sacred City, where he is certain a commendation and grand holy assignment awaits him. But his new flock is made up of unrepentant murderers, practitioners of ghastly magic, and outright monsters. The mission he is tasked with will require bloody measures from them all in order to achieve its righteous ends. Elves lurk at our borders and hunger for our flesh, while greedy princes care for nothing but their own ambitions and comfort. With a hellish journey before him, it's a good thing Brother Diaz has the devils on his side. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.
