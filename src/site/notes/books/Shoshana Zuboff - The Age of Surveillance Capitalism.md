## The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

## My thoughts & notable quotes

This should have been edited to a third of its length.  
  
The author lost herself in never-ending loops, repeating the same concepts ad nauseam - if I had to wager a guess, she is not able to leave highly academic writing habits aside and wrote this book as if it was a PhD thesis.  
  
Sadly, as a PhD thesis, it would have been unsatisfying too. From unconvincing hyperbolic metaphors, meandering tangents about the plight of Native Americans or colonialism that felt almost disrespectful, a lack of proper sources, and an unconvincing basic structure, the writing ended up being atrocious.  
  
It's a shame, because I'm highly interesting in the topic and thematic explorations themselves.  
  
Would recommend reading something else about this.

### Store description

The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior. In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth. Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new "behavioral futures markets," where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new "means of behavioral modification." The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a "Big Other" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled "hive" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit -- at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future. With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future -- if we let it.
