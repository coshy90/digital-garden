## Fushigi Yûgi: Genbu Kaiden, Vol. 8

### Description

Takiko helps Uruki grieve for the loss of a loved one--a loss she knows only too well. But now that the Qudong army knows how to fight Celestial power, Takiko and the Celestial Warriors have no time to lose. As they prepare to rescue Teg, Uruki learns the truth about the prophecy: to summon Genbu, the Priestess will have to sacrifice her life. Refusing to let another death happen, Uruki vows to send Takiko back to the safety of her own world...by any means necessary. -- VIZ Media
