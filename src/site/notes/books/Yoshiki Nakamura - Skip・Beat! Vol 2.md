## Skip・Beat!, Vol. 2

### Description

After failing her audition, Kyoko has just about given up on her revenge--until Sho shows up at the gas station where she works and doesn't even recognize her! With her desire for vengeance rekindled, Kyoko goes back to the talent agency and gets assigned to the new "Love Me Section." There, she can earn points for good behavior, and if she earns enough, the agency will back her debut! The only problem is that she has to do whatever they tell her to! Will her first assignment be her last? -- VIZ Media
