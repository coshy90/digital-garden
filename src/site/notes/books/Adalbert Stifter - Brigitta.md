## Brigitta

### Store description

Stifter's stories are not characterized by depth of plot; indeed there is often no plot at all, but they charm by their lovely pictures of nature and quaint descriptions of country life. One critic has said: His writings all bear the character of landscape painting; they are pictures of still life, in which scenery plays the chief part and man is a subordinate figure. And yet he is a close observer of character, and delights in depicting the moods of the soul and the emotions of the heart. If his writings are pictures of still life, they nevertheless contain a gallery of miniatures, many of which the reader will delight to cherish. Exactly on account of this human interest Brigitta deserves high rank. The Major and Brigitta herself are real per sons, they are characters that live. For its landscape painting, too, Brigitta is admirable. AS we read, we seem to be looking across the Hungarian steppes and watching the varied lights and shadows that traverse them. Perhaps it may not be out of place in this day of realism to commend also the elevated tone of this simple story. Its characters aspire and struggle; they win our love and command our respect.
