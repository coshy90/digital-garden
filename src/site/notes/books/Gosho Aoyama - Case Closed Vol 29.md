## Case Closed, Vol. 29

### Description

Conan isn't sure whether to trust Jodie Saintemillion, the American high school teacher whose ditzy blonde exterior conceals a calculating mind. When a bus is hijacked by desperate criminals, Ms. Saintemillion turns out to be cannier than Conan ever imagined, revealing a head for crime solving and a body for kicking butt. But Anita can't help noticing that wherever Conan's beautiful, mysterious new ally goes, the Syndicate never seems to be far behind... -- VIZ Media
