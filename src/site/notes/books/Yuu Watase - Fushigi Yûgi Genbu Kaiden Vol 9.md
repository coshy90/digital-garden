## Fushigi Yûgi: Genbu Kaiden, Vol. 9

### Description

Travel back to the mystical Universe of the Four Gods in this prequel to hit the hit series Fushigi Yugi! When schoolgirl Takiko Okuda attempts to destroy her father's translation of The Universe of the Four Gods, she is instead sucked into the story, becoming the Priestess of Genbu in an epic journey to find the seven Celestial Warriors! Back in her own world, Takiko tries to forget about The Universe of the Four Gods. Determined to live the life of an ordinary girl in Tokyo in 1923, she returns to her father's home and concentrates on being a loyal daughter--and, soon, a dutiful bride. But she can't leave her other life behind. And while Takiko struggles to cool her still-burning heart, the Celestial Warriors battle through a new ice age!
