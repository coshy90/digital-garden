## Skip・Beat!, Vol. 20

### Description

It's the season of giving in Tokyo, but Lory's granddaughter Maria is in no mood to celebrate. Kyoko, never one to sit out a challenge, finally gets Maria to admit what has her so soured on the holidays. It turns out December 24 is Maria's birthday--and the anniversary of her mother's death! Can Kyoko work a Christmas miracle and give this little girl a happy birthday? -- VIZ Media
