## Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 24

### Description

To defeat an enemy in combat is one thing. To destroy an enemy's spirit by striking at what he holds dearest is another. Kenshin always felt that, so long as he wielded a sakabat√¥, those within his sight could be protected from harm, yet while he is incapacitated by the gargantuan Kujiranami of the "Six Comrades," Enishi seizes upon the opportunity to cripple Kenshin's resolve, and will to fight, for good. If Kaoru dies, will Kenshin's dream of a new Japan die with her? -- VIZ Media
