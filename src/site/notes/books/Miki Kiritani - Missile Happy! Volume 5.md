## Missile Happy! Volume 5

### Description

"Mikako only has half a year left before graduating high school. Then all that's waiting for her is a wonderful and dreamy wedding! Or-- so she thought. The world seems to be conspiring against her as Mikako must overcome family issues, a boyfriend who is acting strange and, to make matters worse-- a whole new enemy. Why can't Mikako just graduate and live in peace?"--Page 4 of cover.
