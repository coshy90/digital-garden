## 4 3 2 1

## My thoughts & notable quotes

*4 3 2 1* left me with complex feelings, which is probably very high praise. The construction of the novel, from the overall story structure to the divergence of the different iterations of Archie Ferguson, are done in a skilled manner and show again why Paul Auster was as revered as he was. The narrative voice was grating - which probably meant the teenage boy / young adult man was executed extremely well; but it can become quite exasperating. While that is a stylistic choice that is still justified by the novel and tone itself, I wish Auster had a more forceful editor by his side. This book should not be as long as it is, and many diatribes, monologues, and repetitions could and should have been tweaked or cut outright. 
The worldbuilding was mostly done by entangling the personal life of Archie with historical events in the US - which might be why many of the potentially impactful moments left me more or less untouched. That's not the fault of the novel or the author, as they clearly positioned the story as such, but as a European, I had a harder time connecting with the various happenings. 

Overall a novel well-worth reading, if one is patient and does not mind slow-moving stories. The story itself was gripping enough to carry me though this, and if you are from the US or have a strong interest in the country's more contemporary history, you'd probably enjoy it even more. 

### Store description

Auster's Booker Prize-shortlisted epic from the author of contemporary classic The New York Trilogy: 'a literary voice for the ages' ( Guardian) 'A masterpiece.' Daily Mail 'Absorbing and immersive . . . the author's greatest novel.' FT SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2017 On March 3rd, 1947, Archibald Isaac Ferguson, the only child of Rose and Stanley Ferguson, is born. From that single beginning, Ferguson's life will take four simultaneous but entirely different paths. Family fortunes diverge. Loves and friendships and passions contrast. Each version of Ferguson's story rushes across the fractured terrain of mid-twentieth century America, in this sweeping story of birthright and possibility, of love and the fullness of life itself. 'Remarkable . . . A novel that contains multitudes.' New York Times 'A vast portrait of the turbulent mid-20th century . . . wonderfully, vividly conveyed.' New Statesman
