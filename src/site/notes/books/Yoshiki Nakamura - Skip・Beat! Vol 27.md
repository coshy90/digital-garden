## Skip・Beat!, Vol. 27

### Description

Kyoko’s having trouble getting into the role of Cain’s sister. But is it because she can’t relate to a spoiled punk princess, or because she can’t let go of the fact that Ren is playing Cain? And Ren faces his own challenge with the situation. Can he stand to have the woman he loves treat him like a brother? -- VIZ Media
