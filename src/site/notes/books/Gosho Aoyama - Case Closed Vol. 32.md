## Case Closed

### Description

The mystery series that inspired the hit anime! R to L (Japanese Style). You're History The legendary samurai Toyotomi Hideyoshi has just died a second time: a historical re-enactor playing Hideyoshi has been killed at the daimyo's own Osaka Castle. Time for Conan to make history stop repeating itself--and for Osaka native Harley Hartwell to pick up a wooden sword and eke out some old-fashioned justice! Then Detective Moore attends a star-studded engagement party on the arm of idol singer Yoko Okinoâ€¦but the festivities are cut short when one of the stars of Yoko's old girl group is found dead in the bathroom. And Conan races to save an American tourist from kidnappers who may be connected to the Syndicate! When ace high school detective Jimmy Kudo is fed a mysterious substance by a pair of nefarious men in black--poof! He is physically tranformed into a first grader. Until Jimmy can find a cure for his miniature malady, he takes on the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and continues to solve all the cases that come his way.
