## Full Moon, Vol. 4

### Description

Mitsuki loves singing, but a malignant tumor in her throat has prevented her from pursuing her passion. However, Mitsuki's life turns around when two fun-loving Shinigami appear to grant her a temporary reprieve from her illness--and give her singing career a magical jump-start. Mitsuki's love for Eichi has helped keep her alive because she promised that one day she would become a famous singer and meet him again. But lately even the memories of Eichi haven't been enough to keep her spirits up. Will Takuto's confessed love for Mitsuki be enough to convince her to live...or will she follow her first love into death?
