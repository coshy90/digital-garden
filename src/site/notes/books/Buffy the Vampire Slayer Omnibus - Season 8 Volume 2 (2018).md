## Buffy the Vampire Slayer Omnibus - Season 8 Volume #2 (2018)

### Description

Buffy the Vampire Slayer Omnibus - Season 8 Volume #2 (2018) Series creator Joss Whedon brought Buffy the Vampire Slayer back to life with this comics-only follow-up to Season 7 of the television show. Aptly named Season 8, these comics are the official sequel to Buffy and continue where the live-action series left off with the Slayer, her friends, and their ongoing challenge to fight the forces of darkness. This oversized omnibus edition is one of two volumes that will contain the entirety of Season 8. view our website https://payhip.com/JuneSkyeBooks
