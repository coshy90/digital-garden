## Autocracy, Inc.

### Description

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • WITH A NEW PREFACE • From the Pulitzer-prize winning author, an alarming account of how autocracies work together to undermine the democratic world, and how we should organize to defeat them "A masterful guide to the new age of authoritarianism... clear-sighted and fearless.”—John Simpson, The Guardian "Especially timely."—The Washington Post We think we know what an autocratic state looks like: There is an all-powerful leader at the top. He controls the police. The police threaten the people with violence. There are evil collaborators, and maybe some brave dissidents. But in the 21st century, there is so much more to it. Nowadays, autocracies work together, from China to Russia to Iran. Corrupt companies and kleptocrats in one country do business with corrupt companies and kleptocrats in another. The police in one country can arm and train the police in another, diplomats band together to bend international rules, and propagandists share resources and themes, pounding home the same messages about the weakness of democracy and the evil of America. Disapproval and sanctions cannot move the autocrats. Even popular opposition movements, from Venezuela to Hong Kong to Moscow, don't stand a chance. The members of Autocracy, Inc, aren't linked by a unifying ideology, like communism, that can be defeated, but by a common desire for power, wealth, and impunity. In this urgent treatise, Anne Applebaum calls for the democracies to fight a new kind of threat. A new preface to the paperback edition highlights the increased relevance of these dangerous dynamics in light of the return of Donald Trump to the American presidency.
