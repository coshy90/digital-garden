## Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 26

### Description

The battle to decide the fate of Meiji-era swordsmanship has begun! Action, romance, and historical intrigue help make Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, the tale of a wandering swordsman set against the backdrop of the Meiji Restoration, one of the most popular Shonen Jump titles among fans to date. Himura Kenshin, once an assassin (or hitokiri ) of ferocious power, now fights to protect the honor of those in need. If there's one thing tough-as-nails street brawler--and ex-Sekih√¥ Army cadet--Sagara Sanosuke can't stand, it's hypocritical, loudmouthed braggarts who talk the talk but are incapable of walking the walk. Finding himself in the middle of a provincial squabble between an old man and the local yakuza, Sano returns to his old "fight merchant" ways and agrees to do some ad hoc butt kicking for pay. But the old man he's hired to tangle with might be his strongest foe to date.
