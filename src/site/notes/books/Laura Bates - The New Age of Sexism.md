## The New Age of Sexism

## My thoughts & notable quotes

Bates presents an impressive amount of perspectives on the topic, and gathered her experiences first-hand wherever possible. 
It is depressive, enraging, and I'd be lying if it doesn't occassionally steal your last, remaining hope in humanity. 
Personally (and professionally), I am very involved with tech and online culture, so Bates' work mainly functioned as a (very good) summary of a contemporary issue rather than providing me with new topics of concern. 

### Store description

‘Laura Bates explains how they built the future – and forgot to put women in it’ CAITLIN MORAN 'Fascinating and essential... I urge you to read every syllable' JO BRAND ‘All men must read this book if they have any interest in a truly just, fair and equal society’ ROBIN INCE AI is here, bringing a seismic shift in the way our society operates. Might this mean a future reimagined on equitable terms for women and marginalised groups everywhere? Not unless we fight for it. At present, power remains largely in the hands of a few rich, white men. New AI-driven technologies, with misogyny baked into their design, are putting women in danger, their rights and safety sacrificed at the altar of profitability and reckless speed. In The New Age of Sexism, Sunday Times bestselling author and campaigner Laura Bates takes us deep into the heart of this rapidly evolving world. She explores the metaverse, confronts deepfake pornography, travels to cyber brothels, tests chatbots, and hears from schools in the grip of online sexual abuse, showing how our lives – from education to work, sex to entertainment – are being infiltrated by easily accessible technologies that are changing the way we live and love. What she finds is a wild west where existing forms of discrimination, inequality and harassment are being coded into the future we will all have little choice about living in – unless we seize this moment to demand change. Gripping, courageous and eye-opening, The New Age of Sexism exposes a phenomenon we can’t afford to ignore any longer. Our future is on the line. We need to act now, before it is too late. ‘Urgent reading for anyone who is interested in the intersection of tech and gender equality, and indeed anyone who wants to be a part of building a better future, free from misogyny’ EMMA-LOUISE BOYNTON ‘A brilliantly researched, incredibly illuminating and frequently chilling account of the next chapter in tech's ongoing assault on our core values. A chapter that is already unfolding around us all’ JAMES O’BRIEN
