## Dragon Ball 1

### Store description

The beginning of a global manga success with over 250 million books sold. The little hermit Son Goku and the city girl Bulma embark on a great adventure together: They want to find the seven mysterious Dragon Balls, with whose help every wish comes true... Akira Toriyama's series made manga and anime enormously popular in Germany, and "Dragon Ball 1" was one of the first manga to be published here faithfully in the Japanese reading direction. The 42 volumes, in which Son Goku transforms from a naive boy into a super warrior with cunning, martial arts, and unshakable optimism, have thrilled generations. Those who know them want to read them again and again â€“ and those who love manga can't ignore them! Completed in 42 volumes
