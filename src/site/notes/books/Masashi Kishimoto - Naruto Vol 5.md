## Naruto, Vol. 5

### Description

They’ve danced along the brink of death during training, but Naruto and friends now face their most terrifying challenge: exams! The ninja-in-training have signed up for the Chûnin Exams, which they must pass to advance to the rank of full-fledged shinobi. Passing or failing as a group, they’re only as strong as their weakest link...Naruto! -- VIZ Media
