## The Master

### Store description

'Federer plays tennis like Michelangelo painted: every stroke is perfection, the end result a masterpiece. Christopher Clarey captured just that' Martina Navratilova 'A deep and enlightening view of Roger's life and career that sports fans will be parsing for decades' Jim Courier 'Deeply reported and crisply written' Wall Street Journal THE NEWLY REVISED BIOGRAPHY OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ICONIC ATHLETES Widely regarded as one of the greatest ever sportspeople, Roger Federer made it look astonishingly easy to climb to the top of his sport in an era of brutal competition and deep cynicism. But his path from temperamental, bleach-blond teenager to one of the most elegant of competitors has been an act of will, not destiny. Federer not only had talent. He had grit. Top international sportswriter Christopher Clarey was on court in Paris for Federer's Grand Slam debut and has interviewed him exclusively more than any other writer - with unique access to his inner circle including coaches and key competitors. Now updated after Federer's retirement, The Master is a thrilling portrait of the workings of unfaltering excellence.
