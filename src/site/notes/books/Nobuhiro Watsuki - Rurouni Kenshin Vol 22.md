## Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 22

### Description

The ghosts of Kenshin's past come to wreak havoc on his future as the fight is literally brought to the doorstep of Kamiya Dojo. Three great battles--three great warriors! My√¥jin Yahiko, the student of swords not yet a man, takes on a fighter more than twice his age. Sagara Sanosuke, the free-wheeling street fighter, learns a new humility and becomes stronger for it. And Himura Kenshin, the former slayer of men, begins to see a way to atone for the sins of the hitokiri... -- VIZ Media
