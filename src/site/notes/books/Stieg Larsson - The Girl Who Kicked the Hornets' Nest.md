## The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest

### Description

THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO RETURNS "Not just the extraordinary conclusion to the trilogy, but a work that contains its own fully-rounded plot . . . Brilliant" Val Mcdermid Lisbeth Salander is a threat to national security. Since she was thirteen, shady government forces have conspired to keep her quiet. Prone to violence, deemed mentally disturbed, she has had her freedom removed and her every movement watched. Yet still, she is an unstoppable force for justice. Salander has a bullet in her head. She is wanted for murder. She knows that the secrets and corruption at the heart of her country's government go right to the top. And she won't take it lying down . . . "Some novels claim to be page-turners, this trilogy is the real deal" Financial Times "This is a grown-up novel for grown-up readers, who want something more than a quick fix and a car chase . . . A publishing phenomenon all over the world" Kate Mosse *** Want more Lisbeth? THE GIRL WITH ICE IN HER VEINS, coming August 2025, is available to pre-order now! ***
