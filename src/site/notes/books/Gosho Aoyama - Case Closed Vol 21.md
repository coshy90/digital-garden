## Case Closed

### Description

Conan and Rachel take to the skies! But their transcontinental detective mission runs into unexpected turbulence when a murder is committed on board their passenger plane. Rachel doesn't think she can solve the case before the plane lands, but then she receives a little in-flight assistance...from none other than the long-lost Jimmy Kudo! Has Conan finally returned to his teenage self? And if so, how? Whatever the answer, Rachel's in for a bumpy flight!
