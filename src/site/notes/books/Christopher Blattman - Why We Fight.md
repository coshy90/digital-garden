## Why We Fight

### Description

Why do human beings fight one another? In this exhilarating and bracing book, we learn the common logic driving vainglorious monarchs, dictators, mobs, pilots, football hooligans, ancient peoples and fanatics. Distilling decades of economics, political science, psychology and real-world interventions, and through his time studying Columbia, Chicago, Liberia and Northern Ireland, Christopher Blattman lifts the lid on the underlying forces governing war and peace. Why did Russia attack Ukraine? Will China invade Taiwan and launch WWIII? And what can any of us do about it? 'Captivating and intelligent' Tim Harford 'Wise, intriguing, imaginative' Rory Stewart 'Nothing could be more relevant today than war and peace . . . an outstanding and original book on this topic' Martin Wolf, Financial Times 'Important, readable, radical' David Miliband 'A great storyteller with important insights for us all' Richard Thaler, co-author of Nudge 'Essential for understanding the world we live in today' James A. Robinson, co-author of Why Nations Fail
