## Case Closed, Vol. 24

### Description

Usually, Conan's mind is focused on detective work. But when Rachel falls for a handsome young doctor at a crime scene, suddenly the pint-size detective can't concentrate on the case. As Rachel threatens to give up on the perennially unavailable Jimmy Kudo, Conan starts to harbor murderous thoughts of his own... Then the Syndicate returns! At a star-studded film festival, Conan and Anita face the shady organization that turned them into kids. But the game changes forever when one of them transforms back to the right age! -- VIZ Media
