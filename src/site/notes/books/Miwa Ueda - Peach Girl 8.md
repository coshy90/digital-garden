## Peach Girl

### Description

Will Sae ever give up her shady ways?​ When Sly Sae blackmails Toji with incriminating pictures of Toji and Goro,​ he feels the only way he can protect Momo is to go along with Sae's scheme and distance himself from her.​ Momo can't believe that her red-hot romance has cooled so suddenly and quickly falls into a deep depression.​ Kiley does his best to cheer her up,​ and Momo soon questions her fiery feelings for him.​ As the new school year begins,​ Momo and Kiley are assigned to the same homeroom - and so are Toji and Sae.​ Everything comes to a head at a school field trip in the mountains,​ when sneaky Sae can't resist pulling another dirty trick on Momo.​ When Kiley heroically saves the day,​ Momo can't help but wonder if he's her knight in shining armor.​..
