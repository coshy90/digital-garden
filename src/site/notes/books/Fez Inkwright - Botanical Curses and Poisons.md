## Botanical Curses and Poisons

### Description

Poison has caused some of history's most dramatic deaths--yet a fine line separates healing from killing: the difference lies in the dosage! Folklorist Fez Inkwright returns to the archives to reveal fascinating stories behind a variety of lethal plants, witching herbs, and funghi. Going from A to Z, she covers everything from apple to oleander, beautifully illustrating each plant herself. This enthralling treasury is packed with insight and lore on the mysteries of everyday flora.
