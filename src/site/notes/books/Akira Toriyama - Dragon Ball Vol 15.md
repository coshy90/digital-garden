## Dragon Ball, Vol. 15

### Store description

Eath's greatest hero...is from outerspace! Dragon Ball introduces a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku (a wry update of the classic Chinese "Monkey King" legend), whose quiet life changes when he meets a girl named Bulma who is on a quest to collect seven "Dragon Balls." If she gathers them all, an incredibly powerful dragon will appear and grant her one wish. But the precious orbs are scattered all over the world, and Bulma could use the help of a certain super-strong boy... (In Japan, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were originally a single 42-volume series. VIZ Media's Dragon Ball contains vols. 1-16 of the original Japanese Dragon Ball, from the beginning of the series to the climax of Goku's last fight with Piccolo.) It's the "Strongest Under the Heavens" martial arts tournament, and the world's greatest fighters have gathered! But Kuririn, Goku, Tenshinhan and Yamcha face mighty enemies. Taopaipai the assassin has returned as a cyborg--and Goku and Tenshinhan are on his hit list! A mysterious young woman has a grudge against Goku. The only "mystery" about bumbling salaryman Shen is how he made it to the final rounds. And the last contestant is the new and improved Piccolo, for whom the championship is just a stepping stone to take over the world...
