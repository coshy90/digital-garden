## Case Closed

### Description

R to L (Japanese Style). It's no great surprise to find a corpse in Kashiragami Forest--the supposedly cursed forest is a popular destination for would-be suicides. But the latest suicide case has the local police suspecting foul play. Then a tall, dark man with a moustache hangs himself at a local hotel...after claiming to be Detective Moore! Are the "suicides" really something more sinister...and is the killer laying a trap for Conan and the real Detective Moore?
