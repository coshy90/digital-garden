## Peach Girl

### Description

With past love-triangles and miscommunications out of the way, Momo is finally with Toji, the boy she loves. It should be a red-hot summer of fun and excitement for them, except they still can't get over their hang-ups. Knowing Toji's history of flaking out, Momo wants him to be as vocal and proud of their relationship as possible, if only to help her feel more secure, but there are already some bumps in the road. Toji, for instance, is embarrassed to make the hand-signal that is their secret way of saying, “I love you.” From his point of view, what guy wouldn't be embarrassed?
