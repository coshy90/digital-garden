## Fushigi Yûgi, Vol. 14

### Description

A Beloved Fantasy From One Of Japan's Top CreatorsProlific shôjo (""girls"") comics artist Yuu Watase has created a wonderfully exciting, funny, and heartfelt tale of a normal junior-high-school girl who is transported into a fictional version of ancient China. She encounters base villains and dashing heroes, and still manages to worry about her grades and where her next banquet is coming from. THE BELOVED ROMANTIC FANTASY SERIES CONTINUES! When Miaka was whisked away into the pages of a mysterious old book, she began a dual existence, divided between her life as an ordinary schoolgirl in modern Japan and her role as a priestess in a fictional version of ancient China. Priestess Miaka and her Celestial Warriors saved the earth from destruction, and in the wake of their triumph, Miaka believed that the world of the book was closed to her forever… but she was wrong! Suzaku’s Prophet The voice of the god Suzaku is invading Miaka’s thoughts, and she is given a new mission: to restore the balance of power between the four gods. To do it, Miaka must defeat a new foe—a rising, monstrous power with ambitions to take over all of the universes!
