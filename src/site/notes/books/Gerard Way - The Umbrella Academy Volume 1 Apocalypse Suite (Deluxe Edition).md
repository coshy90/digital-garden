## The Umbrella Academy Volume 1: Apocalypse Suite (Deluxe Edition)

### Description

The New York Times bestselling comics series that was the inspiration for The Umbrella Academy on Netflix, now on Season 3! In an inexplicable worldwide event, forty-three extraordinary children were spontaneously born by women who'd previously shown no signs of pregnancy. Millionaire inventor Reginald Hargreeves adopted seven of the children; when asked why, his only explanation was, ''To save the world.'' These children form a dysfunctional family with bizarre superpowers. Nearly a decade after their first mission, the team disbands, but when Hargreeves unexpectedly dies, the siblings reunite just in time to save the world once again. This deluxe edition collects the complete Eisner Award-winning series, as well as the short stories ''Mon Dieu!'' and ''But the Past Ain't Through with You." It also includes a 50-page sketchbook section with art by Gerard Way, Gabriel Bá, James Jean, and designer Tony Ong. The 216-page oversized hardcover is bound in leatherette, debossed with an applique of the iconic umbrella symbol, and features foil stamping and a satin ribbon bookmark. Also included is a lithograph featuring a unique new art piece created by Gabriel Bà exclusively for this deluxe edition! The lithograph is enclosed in a leatherette portfolio, debossed with the Umbrella Academy crest. The book and portfolio are enclosed in a beautiful slipcase featuring art by Gabriel Bà, finished with matte lamination and spot gloss UV.
