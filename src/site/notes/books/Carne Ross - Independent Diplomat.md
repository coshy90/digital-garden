## Independent Diplomat

### Description

Independent Diplomat is a compelling insider's account of the foreign policy world. Carne Ross was a diplomat on the front line of today's most pressing issues, from Israel/Palestine to Afghanistan and Iraq, over which he resigned from the British Foreign Office. He was trained to see the world through a prism of states and interests, but the reality of his negotiations revealed very different - more complex, and more human - forces at play. Independent Diplomat exposes this fundamental weakness of institutional diplomacy: exclusion of those most affected by its outcomes, whether at the UN, the EU or within national foreign ministries. Illustrated with vivid episodes from his career - from New York to Kabul - Ross offers a refreshing critique of contemporary diplomacy and of how to put it right.
