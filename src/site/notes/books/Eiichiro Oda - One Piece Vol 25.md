## One Piece, Vol. 25

### Description

Talk about impossible! Luffy and the Straw Hats have to find a way to sail to an island in the sky, and the only one who can show them the way is known to be a greater liar than Usopp! It won't be easy, but can they trust their lives to someone nobody believes in?! -- VIZ Media
