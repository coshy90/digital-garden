### Store description

THE PERFECT CURL-UP READ FOR CAT LOVERS 'Bewitching... as self-possessed and comforting as - well, a cat' SUNDAY TELEGRAPH 'A book about kindness and love, and how the smallest things can provide happiness' STYLIST ___ It's not the journey that counts, but who's at your side. Nana is on a road trip, but he is not sure where he is going. All that matters is that he can sit beside his beloved owner Satoru in the front seat of his silver van. Satoru is keen to visit three old friends from his youth, though Nana doesn't know why and Satoru won't say. Set against the backdrop of Japan's changing seasons and narrated with a rare gentleness and humour, Nana's story explores the wonder and thrill of life's unexpected detours. It is about the value of friendship and solitude, and knowing when to give and when to take. At the heart of this book is a powerful message about the importance of kindness. It shows, above all, how acts of love, both great and small, can transform our lives. ___ Readers love THE TRAVELLING CAT CHRONICLES: 'Delightful, insightful, full of warmth with plenty of humour' 5 stars ***** 'Uplifting and heart wrenching in equal measure' 5 stars ***** 'It had me in floods of tears but filled me with hope too' 5 stars *****
