## Case Closed, Vol. 27

### Description

Conan and his friends take a well-deserved break at a video arcade--until one unlucky gamer is found dead in the seat of a virtual-reality game. As Conan and Rachel investigate, they're joined by an unlikely new accomplice: Rachel's English teacher, Ms. Saintemillion. Outside the classroom, the fast-talking American turns out to have an itchy trigger finger--at least when it comes to video games--and a suspiciously keen interest in Conan. Has the shrunken sleuth stumbled upon a valuable new ally...or an enemy agent? -- VIZ Media
