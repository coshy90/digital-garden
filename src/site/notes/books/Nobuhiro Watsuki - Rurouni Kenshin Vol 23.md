## Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 23

### Description

In order to discover more about the relationship that binds Kenshin and Enishi, Saitô Hajime makes a surprise appearance at Kamiya Dojo--only to find the aftermath of Kenshin, Sanosuke, and Yahiko's desperate life-or-death battles with Enishi's cabal of fighters. One member of the "Six Comrades" remains standing--the mysterious and deadly Yatsume Mumyôi. Will the strength of Saitô Gatotsu be enough to fell this freakish warrior-of-the-shadows?! -- VIZ Media
