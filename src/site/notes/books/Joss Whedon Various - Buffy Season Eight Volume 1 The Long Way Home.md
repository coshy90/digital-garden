## Buffy Season Eight Volume 1: The Long Way Home

### Description

Since the destruction of the Hellmouth, the Slayers—newly legion—have gotten organized and are kicking some serious undead butt. But not everything's fun and firearms, as an old enemy reappears and Dawn experiences some serious growing pains. Meanwhile, one of the "Buffy" decoy Slayers is going through major pain of her own. Buffy creator Joss Whedon brings Buffy back to Dark Horse in this direct follow-up to Season 7 of the smash-hit TV series. The best-selling and critically acclaimed issues #1-#5 are collected here for the first time, as are their covers by Jo Chen and Georges Jeanty. • Collects the first five issues of Season 8. Only available in comics! • "The dialogue is Whedonesque and I can hear how the actors would read [their] lines. It's fun and witty and we're treated to more fantastical stories than the WB/UPN could ever pony up the money to do."—Comic Book Resources • A New York Times best-selling series!
