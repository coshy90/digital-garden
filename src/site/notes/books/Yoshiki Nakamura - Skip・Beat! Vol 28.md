## Skip・Beat!, Vol. 28

### Description

Ren’s new roles are dredging up old memories best left buried, and he’s having trouble dealing with the emotional turmoil. But the President was right when he claimed Kyoko was Ren’s good luck charm. Will her strange but good-natured ways be enough to keep him from his own darkness? -- VIZ Media
