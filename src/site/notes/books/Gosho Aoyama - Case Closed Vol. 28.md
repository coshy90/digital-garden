## Case Closed

### Description

R to L (Japanese Style) When ace high school detective Jimmy Kudo is fed a mysterious substance by a pair of nefarious men in black--poof! He is physically tranformed into a first grader. Until Jimmy can find a cure for his miniature malady, he takes on the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and continues to solve all the cases that come his way. The Mermaid VanishesWhile Conan tries to prove that a corpse found deep in the woods was the victim of more than just a hunting accident, the Junior Detective League gains a new member: a curious bear cub! Then Detective Moore's office is graced by a very traditional lady with very traditional--and very deadly--sword skills. And at a place called Mermaid Island, a woman is found hanged under a waterfall. It seems the legendary mermaid's curse has struck again...unless Conan and Harley Hartwell can find an all-too-human culprit!
