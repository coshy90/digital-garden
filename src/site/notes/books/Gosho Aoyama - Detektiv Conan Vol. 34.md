## Case Closed

### Description

R to L (Japanese Style). The mystery series that inspired the hit anime! The Unusual Suspects The death of a private detective puts Conan back on the trail of the mysterious Syndicate. Now he believes he's identified one of the Men in Black--or, rather, a Woman in Black--as American actress Chris Vineyard. But could the elusive mistress of disguise be closer than Conan realizes? When Conan and Harley Hartwell investigate a suicide in the apartment building of daffy English teacher Jodie Santemillion, they discover more than just foul play. Who is Miss Jodie?
