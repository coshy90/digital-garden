[[books/Khalil Gibran - The Prophet\|Khalil Gibran - The Prophet]]

*You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,
But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.*

*You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps. Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. 
Even those who limp go not backward.*

*When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. 
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.

[[books/Matthew Desmond - Poverty by America\|Matthew Desmond - Poverty by America]]

*A nation that is invested in ending poverty, is truly obsessed committed to freedom. A country besieged by poverty, is not a free country.*

[[books/Fernando Pessoa - The Book of Disquiet\|Fernando Pessoa - The Book of Disquiet]]

*I'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist.*

*I envy everybody for not being me.*
